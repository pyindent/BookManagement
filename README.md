## Project Overview

In the `src/router.js` file, the router is configured with various routes to manage the navigation flow of the Django Vue Book Management App. Here's an overview of the configured routes:

```javascript
const routes = [
  { path: '/', component: Home },
  { path: '/signin', component: SignIn, meta: { requiresAuth: false } },
  { path: '/signup', component: SignUp, meta: { requiresAuth: false } },
  {
    path: '/books',
    children: [
      { path: '', component: BookList, meta: { requiresAuth: true } },
      { path: 'new', component: BookEdit, meta: { requiresAuth: true } },
      { path: ':slug', component: BookDetail, meta: { requiresAuth: true } },
      { path: ':slug/edit', component: BookEdit, meta: { requiresAuth: true } },
    ]
  },
  { path: '/:catchAll(.*)', component: NotFound }
];
```

- **User Routes**

    - **SignUp (`/signup`)**

        This route allows users to create their credentials, including username, email, and password.

    - **SignIn (`/signin`)**

        Users can log in to the application using their credentials, either username or email, along with their password.

- **Books Routes**
    - **Book List (`/books`)**

        When a user is logged in, they are redirected to the book list page.
        Users can search for books by name and description, and the results are displayed in a paginated list.
        Users have the option to delete, edit, or create a book, as well as view the details of each book.

    - **Edit Book (`/books`)**

        Users can edit the title, description, and upload a different image for a specific book.

    - **Create Book (`/books/new`)**

        Users can create a new book by providing a title, description, and uploading an image.

    - **View Book (`/books/:slug`)**

        Users can view the details of a specific book, including its title, description, and image.
    
    - **Delete Book**

      When a user wants to delete a book, they click the "Delete Book" button. A message pops up asking if they're sure. If they say yes, the book gets deleted. This extra step avoids accidental deletions and makes sure users really want to remove the book.


This router configuration provides a seamless and intuitive navigation experience for users interacting with the Django Vue Book Management App.
